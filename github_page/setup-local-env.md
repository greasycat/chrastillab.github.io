To view and edit the documentation locally on your computer, you will need to set up a local development environment using Jekyll, which is a popular static site generator. Follow the steps below to get started:

### Prerequisites

What you need
- Ruby
- RubyGem
- Bundler

### 1. Install Prerequisites

Read the official installation guide [Jekyll official Installation Guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). It will guide your installation of Ruby and RubyGem step-by-step
-  If **Bundler** is not installed after finishing the above guide: Install Bundler by running `gem install bundler` in your terminal.


### 2. Fork to Your Own Repo

### 3. Setting Up the Local Environment

1. Clone **your own** repository to your local machine using the following command:

{: .highlight}
Remember to replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub  username

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/chrastillab.github.io
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository's root directory:

   ```
   cd chrastillab.github.io
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using Bundler:

   ```
   bundle install
   ```

### 4. Viewing the Documentation

1. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start a local development server by running the following command:

   ```
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

2. Open your web browser and visit the following URL:

   [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000)

   You should see the documentation website running locally.
