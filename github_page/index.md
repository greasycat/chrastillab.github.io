GitHub Pages is a web hosting service provided by GitHub for hosting static websites. It allows users to easily publish and share web content, such as documentation, personal blogs, project websites, and more. GitHub Pages is tightly integrated with Git and GitHub repositories, making it a popular choice for developers and teams to showcase their work online.

## Key Features

- **Automated Builds**: GitHub Pages supports automatic generation of websites using static site generators like Jekyll. This enables easy content updates with each repository commit.
